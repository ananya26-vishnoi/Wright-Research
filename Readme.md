# Setup

## Virtual Environment


```bash
python -m venv <name of virtual environment>
```
TO activate - 

Windows:
```bash
.\<name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Unix:
```bash
source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate
```

By activating your virtual environment, you can ensure that any dependencies and packages you install will be isolated from your global environment, making it easier to manage and maintain your project.

## Installing Dependencies


      
To install all the necessary dependencies for your project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
